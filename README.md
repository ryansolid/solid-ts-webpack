# Solid TS Webpack Starter

Really basic starter. This build has a very minimal typescript setup with webpack, and webpack dev server. It has been added css-preprocessor `sass` and its loader, and some useful loaders and plugins. Use this as a quick way to get started if you intend to build your webpack config yourself.
